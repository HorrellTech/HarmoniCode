## What is HarmoniCode?

HarmoniCode is a creative coding environment that lets you generate music using a simple, intuitive programming language called SoundScript. Write a few lines of code and instantly hear your musical creations come to life with real-time audio synthesis.

## Key Features

- **SoundScript Language** - Write music with an easy-to-learn syntax designed specifically for sound generation
- **Audio Visualizers** - See your sound with waveform and frequency spectrum displays
- **Professional Audio Processing** - Shape your sound with built-in compressor and limiter
- **Sample Support** - Incorporate your own audio samples into compositions
- **Interactive Visualizers** - Click to change colors and customize your experience
- **Examples Library** - Learn from pre-built examples covering various techniques
- **WAV Export** - Download your creations as high-quality WAV files *(WIP)*

## How It Works

HarmoniCode leverages Web Audio API and Tone.js to handle audio synthesis directly in your browser. The custom SoundScript language provides a simplified interface for:

- Creating synth instruments with custom parameters
- Sequencing notes and rhythms with precise timing
- Adding effects like reverb, delay, and filtering
- Creating dynamic movement with auto-panning and modulation
- Loading and transforming audio samples

## System Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Internet connection (for initial loading; can work offline afterward)
- Audio output capability
- Keyboard and mouse
